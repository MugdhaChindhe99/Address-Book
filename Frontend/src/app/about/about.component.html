     the About Us page is one of the first supporting pages you'll likely create for your website, regardless of the industry you're in.

    An address book or a name and address book (NAB) is a book or a database used for storing entries called
     contacts. Each contact entry usually consists of a few standard fields (for example: first name, last name,
     ompany name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, fax number, mobile phone number). Most such systems 
     store the details in alphabetical order of people's names, although in paper-based address books entries can
     asily end up out of order as the owner inserts details of more individuals or as people move.
